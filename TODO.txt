there are network differences that cause bidirectional normal vs contraction hierarchy bidirectional to be different.

examples:

367 [ '-118.583787,36.794178', '-117.669144,34.06327' ] 98 '292.38698' 98 '292.38699' 34 '292.94442' 98 '292.38699' 98 '292.38699'
THIS IS a circular loop, ID 477 that causes the problems.  being counted twice.   shouldn't be created at all!
in original it is two separate segments.
create a rule where contraction hierarchy can't make a segment where the start and end are the same coordinate

1185 [ '-118.20678,33.767089', '-117.240219,32.672428' ] 52 '107.85895' 52 '107.85895' 10 '108.26843' 52 '107.85895' 52 '107.85895'
same

i think these are all the same problem

then turn on finding only higher path... see where it is going wrong
