make contraction hierarchy building process faster
-limit hops speed up contraction hierarchy

bothers me that bidirectional dijkstra slower than normal.  change graph to entire USA and see if that holds.


- speedwise would help a bit if edge hash distance lookup could be replaced by storing cost in adjacency list

Directed graph options

ArcFlags

API Design

import {runContraction, Chase} from 'chase-js'
const {runContraction, runValidation, Chase} = require('chase-js');


 reference to my geojson cleanup library in Docs

 runContraction options: { (debug) }
 runValidation (looping segments or otherwise bad geojson)

 return Chase object

 new Chase()

 .saveHierarchy - this is just geojson w extra edges, + arc-flags + options metadata
 .loadHierarchy -
 .query({geojson=true, segmentIds=true, distance=true})
