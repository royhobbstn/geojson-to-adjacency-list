there are network differences that cause bidirectional normal vs contraction hierarchy bidirectional to be different.

examples:

367 [ '-118.583787,36.794178', '-117.669144,34.06327' ] 98 '292.38698' 98 '292.38699' 34 '292.94442' 98 '292.38699' 98 '292.38699'
THIS IS a circular loop, ID 477 that causes the problems.  being counted twice.   shouldn't be created at all!
in original it is two separate segments.
create a rule where contraction hierarchy can't make a segment where the start and end are the same coordinate

then turn on finding only higher path... see where it is going wrong

theory is either witness paths bad

or stopping condition is wrong
