This is a big todo:

367 [ '-118.583787,36.794178', '-117.669144,34.06327' ] 98 '292.38698' 98 '292.38699' 34 '292.94442' 98 '292.38699' 98 '292.38699'
THIS IS a circular loop, ID 477 that causes the problems.  being counted twice.   shouldn't be created at all!
in original it is two separate segments.
create a rule where contraction hierarchy can't make a segment where the start and end are the same coordinate


fix up above

bothers me that bidirectional dijkstra slower than normal.  change graph to entire USA and see if that holds.


- speedwise would help a bit if edge hash distance lookup could be replaced by storing cost in adjacency list

Directed graph options

- after: parallel bidijkstra


ArcFlags

make contraction hierarchy building process faster

after: golang
